# CONTRIBUTORS Guide

## How to get started?

The easiest way to start is to look at existing issues and see if there’s something there that you’d like to work on. You can filter issues with the label “[issue](https://github.com/DipakChandan/DT-miniPOC/issues)” which are relatively self sufficient issues and great for first time contributors.

Once you decide on an issue, please comment on it so that all of us know that you’re on it.

If you’re looking to add a new feature, [raise a new issue](https://github.com/DipakChandan/DT-miniPOC/issues/new) and start a discussion with the community. Engage with the maintainers of the project and work your way through.

You'll need to perform the following tasks in order to submit your changes:

- Fork the `DT-miniPOC` repository.
- Create a branch for your changes. 
  - In case if you're picking up an issue, thenname your branch corresponds to an `issue_id`
- Add commits to that branch.
- Open a [PR](https://github.com/DipakChandan/DT-miniPOC/compare) and choose your `branch_name` to share your contribution.

## HERE’S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TO PARTICIPATE AND COMPLETE HACKTOBERFEST:

## PULL/MERGE REQUEST DETAILS
### HERE’S HOW WE VALIDATE CONTRIBUTOR PULL/MERGE REQUESTS (“PR/MRS”)

### [ RULE ]

- Your PR/MRs must be made to a public, unarchived repository.
- YOUR PR/MRS MUST NOT BE SPAMMY.
- Once your PR/MR has passed this check, we won’t check this again (unless your PR/MR fails a check before this, such as it being marked as spammy).
- YOUR PR/MRS MUST NOT BE LABELED AS “INVALID”.
- PR/MRs that have a label containing the word “invalid” won’t be counted
- YOUR PR/MRS MUST BE MERGED
- Your PR/MR must not be a draft to be considered accepted.
- ONCE YOUR PR/MRS PASS ALL THE CHECKS ABOVE, IT WILL BE ACCEPTED
